# My Hanger

[![Fritz in the 'Verse](/images/fritz-in-the-verse.png)](/star-citizen/)

Hey all!  This is just a simple list of my current hangar! The overall structure is currently a work in progress.
In the future I plan on adding links to each ship's wiki page to help provide more information.  I will also be adding
comments about why and how I use specific ships.

#### Ship Types:

- **Solo Ships:** _Vehicles that are sole solo ships.  No room for any additional crew._
- **Flexi-Crew Ships:** _Vehicles that can be flown effectively solo or with additional crew members._
- **Multi-Crew Ships:** _Vehicles that can only be flown effectively with a crew and have heavily reduced capabilities when flown solo._

#### Symbol Legend:

```
-- : LTI Tokens / Soon to be Replaced
++ : Unreleased Ships
```

        - _RSI_ **Constellation Taurus**

        - ++_Misc_ **Odyssey**
            - `Please go into 'Active Production' sooner rather than later... PLEASE! Depending on hanger size and minng/refining capablilites, this could replace the Polaris as a solo mothership, allowing thoes funds to be used elsewhere.`
