Hey all!  This is just a simple list of my current hangar! The overall structure is currently a work in progress.
In the future I plan on addding links to each ship's wiki page to help provide more information.  I will also be adding
comments about why and how I use specific ships.

#### Ship Types:

- **Solo Ships:** _Vehicles that are soley solo ships.  No room for any additional crew._
- **Flexi-Crew Ships:** _Vehicles that can be flown effectively solo or with additional crew members._
- **Multi-Crew Ships:** _Vehicles that can only be flown effectively with a crew and have heavily reduced capabilities when flown solo._

#### Symbol Legend:

```
-- : LTI Tokens / Soon to be Replaced
++ : Unreleased Ships
```

        - _RSI_ **Constellation Taurus**
            - `I am using the Taurus as my primary PVE solo ship. Big shields and big guns... what else does one need?`
