# My Hanger

[![Fritz in the 'Verse](/images/fritz-in-the-verse.png)](/star-citizen/)

Hey all!  This is just a simple list of my current hangar! The overall structure is currently a work in progress.
In the future I plan on addding links to each ship's wiki page to help provide more information.  I will also be adding
comments about why and how I use specific ships.

#### Ship Types:

- **Solo Ships:** _Vehicles that are soley solo ships.  No room for any additional crew._
- **Flexi-Crew Ships:** _Vehicles that can be flown effectively solo or with additional crew members._
- **Multi-Crew Ships:** _Vehicles that can only be flown effectively with a crew and have heavily reduced capabilities when flown solo._

#### Symbol Legend:

```
-- : LTI Tokens / Soon to be Replaced
++ : Unreleased Ships
```

        - _RSI_ **Polaris**
            - `The main reason for getting a Polaris is for off-grid operations.  It is mostly to act as my solo 'mother ship'.  With that being said it would be exciting to use it for large multi-crew operations as well.`
