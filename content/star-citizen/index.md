## Star Citizen

Set in the 30th century within the human-dominated United Empire of Earth (UEE), ["Star Citizen"](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/) invites players to explore a 
vast, persistent universe. Players can pilot starships to explore, trade, mine, salvage, or fight in an attempt to 
forge their own path among allies and adversaries.

### My Journey

This blog is filled with my adventures as I traverse this game... _this galaxy!_ In the "Adventure Blog" you can find
the stories of my epic adventures in Star Citizen and my personal opinions about the game.  I have also included a
link to "My Hangar" where you can find an up-to-date list of all the ships I own Star Citizen.
